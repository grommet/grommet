## Grid
Documentation for this component: https://v2.grommet.io/grid

A grid system for laying out content. To use, define the
rows and columns, create area names for adjacent cells, and then
place Box components inside those areas using the gridArea property.
See https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/.
The availability of Grid can be tested via `Grid.available`. Use this
to create fallback rendering for older browsers, like ie11.
